### Replicate Success of Branch A

- Conduct a performance audit of Branch A: staff efficiency, layout, local marketing, etc.

### Maximize Potential in Yangon

- Since Yangon has the most customers, invest in location-specific campaigns, product availability, and services there.
- Explore whether more outlets or delivery options could capture further market share.

### Segment and Target Female Shoppers
- Develop marketing content, bundles, or promotions tailored to female customers, particularly in product categories like fashion, beauty, and lifestyle.

### Optimize Low-Margin High-Volume Products

Consider:

- Upselling during checkout

###  Investigate Declining Annual Profit
